    <ul>The necessary packages are:
        <li>OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).</li>
        <li>TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).</li>
        <li>Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).</li>
        <li>Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Dataset :</h2>
    <p>We have used the downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is been attached in the github, and you can download the dataset from <a href =https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new </a> as well.</p>

<h2>Execution : </h2>
